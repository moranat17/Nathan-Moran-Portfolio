# Nathan Moran - Computer Information Systems Portfolio

### Data Analytics: This folder contains files from CIS 444 - Data Analytics

* CIS 444 introduced big data concepts. In this course correlation and simple regressions were reinforced. Data transformations were then introduced. As well as multiple and logistic regressions, analysis of variance and time series analysis. The course wrapped up with two and three way interactions. 

### Database Design: This folder contains files from CIS 310 - Database Design##

* CIS 310 provided a solid and practical foundation for the design and implementation of database systems. Emphasis was on relational database models, with significant coverage of basic relational database concepts, normalization, E-R modeling, locking, SQL, and distributed databases. Additional topics included web databases, database security, access control policies and procedures, risk management, and ethical aspects of information handling. Course software included current database tools such as SQL server.

### Infrastructure Technology: This colder contains files from CIS 350 - Infrastructure Technology

* CIS 350 introduced fundamental concepts relating data representation and data formats; computer hardware, architecture, and networks; operating systems; and data communications. It also provided some experience with different operating systems such as UNIX/Linux. Finally it introduced systems concepts as well as client/server and web-based computing and applications.

### Management of Information Systems: This folder contains files from CIS 410 - Management of Information Systems

* CIS 410 explored strategic development of information technology; value chain analysis and its application to information resource management; information systems planning; organizing, staffing, and controlling the deployment of information technology; the development of an IT platform and architecture consistent with organizational structure.

### Resumes: This folder contains up-to-date copies of my business resume and technical resume. 

### Software Development: This folder contains files from CIS 199 - Software Development I

* CIS 199 introduced object-oriented concepts such as the use of classes, methods, encapsulation, and inheritance. The course concentrated on using object-oriented programming to solve simple problems involving input and output. Computer lab sessions reinforced programming concepts.

### System Development: This folder contains files from CIS 420 - CIS Development Project

* CIS 420 is a continuation of CIS 320, this course focused on the detailed design and implementation phases of the system development life cycle, including user acceptance testing, test planning, design reviews, and change procedures. Specifications created in CIS 320 were used to implement, test, and install a working version of an information system. System deployment emphasizes a web-based architecture. A prototyping approach was taken to develop and test the system in an iterative manner.

### Systems Analysis and Design: This folder contains files from CIS 320 - Systems Analysis and Design

* CIS 320 introduced the fundamentals of object-oriented analysis and design, including experience with a CASE tool. Topics included requirements determination, feasibility analysis, modeling with Unified Modeling Language (UML) and data dictionary construction, data modeling and normalization, user interface requirements specification, and information security procedures. Development of problem and design specifications for an information systems project was required. Developed team skills, written and oral communication skills.
